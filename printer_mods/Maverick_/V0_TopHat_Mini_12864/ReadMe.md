# V0 TopHat Mini 12864

I wanted to have the ability to use the V2 display with my V0, so designed this mod to allow for it. Although they look similar, the Mini 12864 front and back case files have been slightly altered to accomodate this design.

M3 threaded inserts are used in the lower wall of the back case file, this allows for M3 screws to be ran through the TopHat pieces into the case, resulting in a solid configuration. 

The parts are in the correct orientation for printing.
