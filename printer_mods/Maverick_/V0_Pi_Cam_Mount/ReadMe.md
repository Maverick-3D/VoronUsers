# V0 Pi Cam Mount

Mount to allow for a Pi Cam to be mounted on a corner bracket of the TopHat.

Very basic in it's design, it's mounted utilizing the same (or slightly longer) screw used to attach the bracket to the TopHat body. 

M2 screws are used to attach the Pi Cam to the mount. If angle adjustments are needed, M2 nuts can be placed on the screws to make the desired changes.
